# Reservation - Frontend coding challenge

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I did keep my development under 2 hours as requested by the challenge description. This left many features of the app partially or completely undeveloped, which I will explain below

### To start the app, run `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### Packages used

Tailwind CSS, Material UI, React Router
